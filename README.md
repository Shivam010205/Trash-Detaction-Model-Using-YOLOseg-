# 🌊 Underwater Waste Detection using YOLOv8

🚀 A deep learning–based computer vision project that detects underwater and ocean waste using **YOLOv8**, helping address marine pollution through AI.

---

## ✨ Why this Project?
Marine pollution is a serious environmental issue. Identifying waste underwater is difficult due to low visibility and complex backgrounds.  
This project leverages **state-of-the-art object detection (YOLOv8)** to automatically detect underwater waste from images, making monitoring more efficient and scalable.

## 🧠 What This Project Does
- Trains a **YOLOv8 object detection model**
- Detects underwater/ocean waste with bounding boxes
- Uses a **Roboflow-labeled dataset**
- Performs preprocessing and denoising for better accuracy
- Supports training, validation, and inference

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)**
- **Roboflow**
- **OpenCV**
- **PyTorch**
